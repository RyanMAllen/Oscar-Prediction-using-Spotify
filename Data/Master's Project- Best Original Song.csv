2019,(I'm Gonna) Love Me Again,1q8lLOgfciaGLwXCvOpH6w,1,,"Oh, the joke was never hard to tell
Threw my spare change in the wishing well
The dream alone is always in your hands
If that don't fill the boy and build the man
A heart has many secrets, so I'm told
Through the years, a theory can grow cold
I'm up to be the king, it's gotten clear
The voice inside my head is the one I hear
Singing, I'm gonna love me again
Check in on my very best friend
Find the wind to fill my sails
Rise above the broken rails
Unbound by any ties that break or bend
I'm free, and don't you know?
No clown to claim he used to know me then
I'm free, and don't you know?
And oh-oh-oh, I'm gonna love me again
The golden age was somehow bittersweet
But now the past lies sleepin' in the deep
The peaceful days that followed hollow nights
A kiss or touch could feel like Kryptonite
Praise the Saints that hung up on my wall
For trust is left in lovers after all
A whispered word emergin' from a tale
My wake-up call to claim the cursed spell
Well, I'm gonna love me again (love me again)
Check in on my very best friend
Find the wind to fill my sails
Rise above the broken rails
Unbound by any ties that break or bend
I'm free, and don't you know?
No clown to claim he used to know me then
I'm free, and don't you know?
And oh-oh-oh, I'm gonna love me again
Sing, I'm gonna love me again
Check in on my very best friend
Find the wind to fill my sails
Rise above the broken rails
Unbound by any ties that break or bend
I'm free, and don't you know?
No clown to claim he used to know me then
I'm free, don't you know?
And oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, I'm gonna love me again
I'm gonna love me again
I'm gonna love me again"
2019,I'm Standing With You,7AlVjh1sSW5PLtqhoNgHPP,0,,"When your hurting, I want you to know
That you'll never have to hurt alone
When your faith is, faith is running low
I'll never lose faith in you
When the night surrounds you
And you think that no one cares about you
I will go and throw my arms around you
I'll be there
Through whatever you go through
I'm standin' with you
Here wherever you go to
I'll stand beside you
And when you think that all the odds are all against you
And you just feel like giving up, well, I won't let you
Through whatever you go through
I'm standing with you
I'm standing with you
We all got time's when we can't be strong
When it feels like, like all hope is gone
But I'm right here, right here to lean on
I'll always be strong for you
And when you're feeling broken
And it's seems like every door is closing
Want you to know that mine is always open
I'll be there
Through whatever you go through
I'm standin' with you
Here wherever you go to (You go to)
I'll stand beside you
And when you think that all the odds are all against you
And you just feel like giving up, well, I won't let you
Through whatever you go through (You go through)
I'm standing with you
I'm standing with you
Nothing you can do can move me
You can try, but you can't lose me
You can't lose me
Through whatever you go through
I'm standing with you
And wherever you go to (You go to), I'll stand beside you
And when you think that all the odds are all against you
And you just feel like giving up, well, I won't let you
Through whatever you go through (through whatever you go through)
I'm standing with you
(I'm standing)
I'm standing with you (I'm standing)
I'm standing with you (I'm standing)
I'm standing with you (I'm standing)
(I'm standing)
I'm standing with you (I'm standing)
I'm standing, with you, with you (I'm standing)

I'm standing with you"

Into the unknown
Into the unknown
(Oh)
I can hear you but I won't
Some look for trouble while others don't
There's a thousand reasons I should go about my day
And ignore your whispers which I wish would go away, oh
Whoa
You're not a voice, you're just a ringing in my ear
And if I heard you, which I don't, I'm spoken for I fear
Everyone I've ever loved is here within these walls
I'm sorry, secret siren, but I'm blocking out your calls
I've had my adventure, I don't need something new
I'm afraid of what I'm risking if I follow you
Into the unknown
Into the unknown
Into the unknown
(Oh)
(Oh)
What do you want? 'Cause you've been keeping me awake
Are you here to distract me so I make a big mistake?
Or are you someone out there who's a little bit like me?
Who knows deep down I'm not where I'm meant to be?
Every day's a little harder as I feel your power grow
Don't you know there's part of me that longs to go
Into the unknown?
Into the unknown
Into the unknown
(Oh)
(Oh)
Whoa
Are you out there?
Do you know me?
Can you feel me?
Can you show me?

Where are you going? Don't leave me alone
How do I follow you
Into the unknown?

2019,Stand Up,0Ppjgu01pLU3iBVaXaPt3M,0,,"I been walkin'
With my face turned to the sun
Weight on my shoulders
A bullet in my gun
Oh, I got eyes in the back of my head
Just in case I have to run
I do what I can when I can while I can for my people
While the clouds roll back and the stars fill the night
That's when I'm gonna stand up
Take my people with me
Together we are going
To a brand new home
Far across the river
Can you hear freedom calling?
Calling me to answer
Gonna keep on keepin' on
I can feel it in my bones
Early in the mornin'
Before the sun begins to shine
We're gonna start movin'
Towards that separating line
I'm wadin' through muddy waters
You know I got a made up mind
And I don't mind if I lose any blood on the way to salvation
And I'll fight with the strength that I got until I die
So I'm gonna stand up
Take my people with me
Together we are going
To a brand new home
Far across the river
Can you hear freedom calling?
Calling me to answer
Gonna keep on keepin' on
And I know what's around the bend
Might be hard to face 'cause I'm alone
And I just might fail
But Lord knows I tried
Sure as stars fill up the sky
Stand up
Take my people with me
Together we are going
To a brand new home
Far across the river
Can you hear freedom calling?
Calling me to answer
Gonna keep on keepin' on
I'm gonna stand up
Take my people with me
Together we are going
To a brand new home
Far across the river
Do you hear freedom calling?
Calling me to answer
Gonna keep on keepin' on
I'm gonna stand up
Take my people with me
Together we are going
To a brand new home
Far across the river
I hear freedom calling
Calling me to answer
Gonna keep on keepin' on
I can feel it in my bones
I go to prepare a place for you
I go to prepare a place for you
I go to prepare a place for you
I go to prepare a place for you"

2018,Shallow,2VxeLyX666F8uXCJ0dZF8B,1,,"Tell me somethin', girl
Are you happy in this modern world?
Or do you need more?
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?
I'm falling
In all the good times I find myself
Longin' for change
And in the bad times I fear myself
Tell me something, boy
Aren't you tired tryin' to fill that void?
Or do you need more?
Ain't it hard keeping it so hardcore?
I'm falling
In all the good times I find myself
Longing for change
And in the bad times I fear myself
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now
In the shallow, shallow
In the shallow, shallow
In the shallow, shallow
We're far from the shallow now
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Whoah!
I'm off the deep end, watch as I dive in
I'll never meet the ground
Crash through the surface, where they can't hurt us
We're far from the shallow now
In the shallow, shallow

We're far from the shallow now"
2018,When a Cowboy Trades His Spurs for Wings,4uoYksfELX8RKYJYZQael4,0,,"Let me tell you, buddy
There's a faster gun
Coming over yonder
When tomorrow comes
Let me tell you, buddy
And it won't be long
Till you find yourself singing
Your last cowboy song
Yippee-ki-iy-ay
When the round-up ends
Yippee-ki-iy-ay
And the campfire dims
Yippee-ki-iy-ay
He shouts and he sings
When a cowboy trades his spurs for wings
When they wrap my body
In the thin linen sheet
And they take my six irons
Pull the boots from my feet
Unsaddle my pony
She'll be itching to roam
I'll be halfway to heaven
Under horsepower of my own
Yippee-ki-iy-ay
When the round-up ends
Yippee-ki-iy-ay
And the campfire dims
Yippee-ki-iy-ay
He shouts and he sings
When a cowboy trades his spurs for wings
Yippee-ki-iy-ay
I'm glory-bound
No more jingle jangle
I lay my guns down
Yippee-ki-iy-ay
He shouts and he sings
When a cowboy trades his spurs for wings"

Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you?

All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer
This maybe the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer
Tell me what you gon' do to me
Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword
Bring a morgue, but you can't bring the truth to me
Fuck you and all your expectations
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence and calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I ain't invite you
Oh, you important?
You the moral to the story, you endorsing?
Motherfucker, I don't even like you
Corrupt a man's heart with a gift
That's how you find out who you dealin' with
A small percentage, who I'm building with
I want the credit if I'm losing or I'm winning
On my momma that's the realest shit
Girl, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you?
I know the feeling haunt you
This maybe the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer
This maybe the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer, all the stars are closer, all the stars are closer
Skin covered in ego
Get to talkin', like ya involved, like a rebound
No control, no off switch and the way that you bringin' me down
It's a turn on, get it away from me
Know you mean wrong, keep away from me
And it's all wrong, get it away from me, yeah
I just cry for no reason, I just pray for no reason
I just thank for the life, for the day, for the hours and another life breathin'
I did it all 'cause it feel good
You could live it all if you feel bad
Better live your life
We are running out of time
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you?
I know the feeling haunt you
This maybe the night that my dreams might let me know

2018,The Place Where Lost Things Go,6BK8BcFxMFr3JVUaAOZsYC,0,,"Do you ever lie
Awake at night?
Just between the dark
And the morning light
Searching for the things
You used to know
Looking for the place
Where the lost things go
Do you ever dream
Or reminisce?
Wondering where to find
What you truly miss
Well maybe all those things
That you love so
Are waiting in the place
Where the lost things go
Memories you've shed
Gone for good you feared
They're all around you still
Though they've disappeared
Nothing's really left
Or lost without a trace
Nothing's gone forever
Only out of place
So maybe now the dish
And my best spoon
Are playing hide and seek
Just behind the moon
Waiting there until
It's time to show
Spring is like that now
Far beneath the snow
Hiding in the place
Where the lost things go
Time to close your eyes
So sleep can come around
For when you dream you'll find
All that's lost is found
Maybe on the moon
Or maybe somewhere new
Maybe all you're missing lives inside of you
So when you need her touch
And loving gaze
Gone but not forgotten
Is the perfect phrase
Smiling from a star
That she makes glow
Trust she's always there
Watching as you grow
Find her in the place
Where the lost things go"
2018,I'll Fight,7ELxtyrasiOfwsRUJiEMGR,0,,"When you feel you're taking all that you can take
And you're sure you're never gonna catch a break
And the tears are rivers running down your face, yeah
When your faith is low and you've got no strength left
When you think you've gone as far as you can get
And you're too undone to take another step
Oh I will take up the struggle
Oh I know it's a fight
So I'll fight, fight that war for you
I'll fight, stand and defend you
Take your side, that's what I'm here to do
I'll be there to be strong
Oh I'll keep on, keep on the fight
When it's dangerous, takes another piece of you
Everybody takes all they can get from you
Till you're left with almost nothing left of you
When each night is like a battle you can't win
And the pain is like a weight you're carrying
I will be the one to help you carry it
Oh I will take all your troubles
Oh I know it's a fight
So I'll fight, fight that war for you

Remember me, though I have to say goodbye
Remember me, don't let it make you cry
For even if I'm far away I hold you in my heart
I sing a secret song to you each night we are apart
Remember me, though I have to travel far

United in our song, with you I'll be there
Remember me, if you think you're alone
remember me, and my singing is gonna embrace you
Even In the distance you're never gonna forget, the fact that I'll be always with you
 

If you close your eyes and let the music play
Keep our love alive, I'll never fade away
If you close your eyes and let the music play
Keep our love alive, I'll never fade away
If you close your eyes and let the music play
Keep our love alive, I'll never fade away
Remember me, for I will soon be gone
Remember me, and let the love we have live on
And know that I'm with you the only way that I can be
So, until you're in my arms again

The first time that you kissed me
Boundless by the time I cried
I built your walls around me
White noise, what an awful sound
Fumbling by Rogue River
Feel my feet above the ground
Hand of God, deliver me
Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me
The first time that you touched me
Oh, will wonders ever cease?
Blessed be the mystery of love
Lord, I no longer believe
Drowned in living waters
Cursed by the love that I received
From my brother's daughter
Like Hephaestion, who died
Alexander's lover
Now my riverbed has dried
Shall I find no other?
Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me
I'm running like a plover
Now I'm prone to misery
The birthmark on your shoulder reminds me
How much sorrow can I take?
Blackbird on my shoulder
And what difference does it make
When this love is over?
Shall I sleep within your bed
River of unhappiness
Hold your hands upon my head
'Til I breathe my last breath
Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me
The last time that you touched me

2017,Stand Up for Something,44r3hRXVBDA3ZeKxdFvm8l,0,,"You can have all the money in your hands
All the possessions anyone can ever have
But it's all worthless treasure, true worth is only measured
Not by what you got, but what you got in your heart
You can have, you can have everything
What does it, what does it mean?
It all means nothing
If you don't stand up for something
You can't just talk the talk
You got to walk that walk, yes you do
It all means nothing
If you don't stand up for something
And I stand up for you
And I stand up for you, yes I will, yes I will
You do the best that, do the best that you can do
Then you can look in the mirror
Proud of who's looking back at you
Define the life you're living
Not by what you take or what you're givin'
And if you bet on love there's no way you'll ever lose
Take a stand, make a stand for what's right
It's always worth, always worth the fight
It all means nothing
If you don't stand up for something
You can't just talk the talk
You got to walk that walk, yes you do
It all means nothing
If you don't stand up for something
And I stand up for you
Stand for respect, dignity
If that's all you got, then you got all you need
And without that, you don't have a thing, oh, no, no
Rise up, love, lift your hands
I stand with you 'cause I understand
Ain't here to judge, just to take a stand
The greater plan's the Creator's plan
Let's all rise like the day began
Reach out and touch with the Savior's hand
On rock, we stand like this native land
Let the ways of love be the ways of man
And it all means nothing
If you don't stand for something
You can't just talk the talk
You got to walk that walk, yes you do
It all means nothing
If you don't stand up for something
And I stand up for you (stand up, stand for you)
I stand up for you (stand up)

Stand up for you, yes I will, yes I will (stand up)"

And there's a place at the table that you saved for me
So many thousand miles over land and sea
I hope to dare, that you hear my prayer
And somehow I'll be there
It's but a concrete floor where my head will lay
And though the walls of this prison are as cold as clay
But there's a shaft of light where I count my days
So don't despair of the empty chair
And somehow I'll be there
Some days I'm strong, some days I'm weak
And days I'm so broken I can barely speak
There's a place in my head where my thoughts still roam
Where somehow I've come home
And when the Winter comes and the trees lie bare
And you just stare out the window in the darkness there
Well I was always late for every meal you'll swear
But keep my place and the empty chair

And somehow I'll be there"
2016,Audition (The Fools Who Dream),6j0wBBAP3hMe4t1Ymj7GIe,0,,"My aunt used to live in Paris 
I remember, she used to come home and tell us these stories about being abroad 
And I remember she told us that she jumped into the river once, barefoot
She smiled
Leapt, without looking
And tumbled into the Seine
The water was freezing
She spent a month sneezing
But said she would do it again
Here's to the ones who dream
Foolish as they may seem
Here's to the hearts that ache
Here's to the mess we make
She captured a feeling
Sky with no ceiling
The sunset inside a frame
She lived in her liquor
And died with a flicker
I'll always remember the flame
Here's to the ones who dream
Foolish as they may seem
Here's to the hearts that ache
Here's to the mess we make
She told me
""A bit of madness is key
To give us new colors to see
Who knows where it will lead us?
And that's why they need us""
So bring on the rebels
The ripples from pebbles
The painters, and poets, and plays
And here's to the fools who dream
Crazy as they may seem
Here's to the hearts that break
Here's to the mess we make
I trace it all back to then
Her, and the snow, and the Seine
Smiling through it
She said she'd do it again"
2016,How Far I'll Go,6mb6lVLNrcUgLnEN8QnDJd,0,,"I've been staring at the edge of the water
'Long as I can remember, never really knowing why
I wish I could be the perfect daughter
But I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try
Every turn I take, every trail I track
Every path I make, every road leads back
To the place I know, where I can not go, where I long to be
See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
And no one knows, how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know, if I go there's just no telling how far I'll go
I know everybody on this island, seems so happy on this island
Everything is by design
I know everybody on this island has a role on this island
So maybe I can roll with mine
I can lead with pride, I can make us strong
I'll be satisfied if I play along
But the voice inside sings a different song
What is wrong with me?
See the light as it shines on the sea? It's blinding
But no one knows, how deep it goes
And it seems like it's calling out to me, so come find me
And let me know, what's beyond that line, will I cross that line?
The line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me
And no one knows, how far it goes
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me
One day I'll know, how far I'll go"

Between the leaves
All the growing
That we did

All the loving
And separating
All the turning
To face each other

I divide
In the sky
In the the seams
Between the beams

All the loving
And separating
All the turning
To face each other

Without biodiversity
I'm nothing
It's like I never
Existed

Without my home
With no reflection
I cease to exist

I’ll be right there
I’ll never forget you
I will leave lessons behind
I feel complete
I’ve got a feeling
I wish your body like rain

It will be ours, it will be ours
Oh one day when the war is won
We will be sure, we will be sure
Oh glory (Glory, glory)
Oh (Glory, glory)
Hands to the Heavens, no man, no weapon
Formed against, yes glory is destined
Every day women and men become legends
Sins that go against our skin become blessings
The movement is a rhythm to us
Freedom is like religion to us
Justice is juxtapositionin' us
Justice for all just ain't specific enough
One son died, his spirit is revisitin' us
Truant livin' livin' in us, resistance is us
That's why Rosa sat on the bus
That's why we walk through Ferguson with our hands up
When it go down we woman and man up
They say, ""Stay down"", and we stand up
Shots, we on the ground, the camera panned up
King pointed to the mountain top and we ran up
One day when the glory comes
It will be ours, it will be ours
Oh one day when the war is won
We will be sure, we will be sure
Oh glory (Glory, glory)
Oh (Glory, glory)
Now the war is not over, victory isn't won
And we'll fight on to the finish, then when it's all done
We'll cry glory, oh glory (Glory, glory)
Oh (Glory, glory)
We'll cry glory, oh glory (Glory, glory)
Oh (Glory, glory)
Selma's now for every man, woman and child
Even Jesus got his crown in front of a crowd
They marched with the torch, we gon' run with it now
Never look back, we done gone hundreds of miles
From dark roads he rose, to become a hero
Facin' the league of justice, his power was the people
Enemy is lethal, a king became regal
Saw the face of Jim Crow under a bald eagle
The biggest weapon is to stay peaceful
We sing, our music is the cuts that we bleed through
Somewhere in the dream we had an epiphany
Now we right the wrongs in history
No one can win the war individually
It takes the wisdom of the elders and young people's energy
Welcome to the story we call victory
The comin' of the Lord, my eyes have seen the glory
One day when the glory comes
It will be ours, it will be ours
Oh one day when the war is won
We will be sure, we will be sure
Oh glory (Glory, glory)
Oh (Glory, glory)
Oh glory (Glory, glory)

Please don't see just a boy caught up in dreams and fantasies
Please see me reaching out for someone I can't see
Take my hand let's see where we wake up tomorrow
Best laid plans sometimes are just a one night stand
I'll be damned Cupid's demanding back his arrows
So let's get drunk on our tears and
God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and this lamb is on the run
We're searching for meaning
So are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?
Who are we? Just a speck of dust within the galaxy?
Woe is me, if we're not careful turns into reality
Don't you dare let all our best memories bring you sorrow
Yesterday I saw a lion kiss a deer
Turn the page maybe we'll find a brand new ending
Where we're dancing in our tears and
God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and this lamb is on the run
We're searching for meaning
So are we all lost stars, trying to light up the dark?

The weight all of the pain was weighing me down
Pulled it together and I pulled myself out
Learned a lesson, learned a lesson
That there's a lot you gotta go through, hell yes

And I've got only love, got no bitterness
Count my blessings, count my blessings, yeah

Not gonna miss you

Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I'm the queen

Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I've tried
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Well, now they know
Let it go, let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door
I don't care what they're going to say
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway
Let it go, let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door
Let it go (go, go, go go, go go, go go, go, go, go go)
Let it go
Let it go
Let it go
It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me can't get to me at all
It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me
I'm free
Let it go, let it go
I am one with the wind and sky
Let it go, let it go
You'll never see me cry
Here I stand and here I stay
Let the storm rage on
My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never going back, the past is in the past
Let it go
The cold never bothered me anyway
Let it go, let it go
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go
That perfect girl is gone
Here I stand in the light of day
Let the storm rage on"

2012,Skyfall,6VObnIkLVruX4UVyxWhlqm,1,,"This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again
For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall
At skyfall
Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number, you can take my name
But you'll never have my heart
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall
Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me
Without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we'll stand
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall
Let the sky fall
We will stand tall

2012,Before My Time,1AFhpXt3ZLTVXal8q4VQcO,0,,"Cold feet, don't fail me now
So much left to do
If I should run ten thousand miles home
Would you be there?
Just a taste of things to come
I still smile
But I don't want to die alone
I don't want to die alone
Way before my time
Keep calm and carry on
No worse for the wear
I don't want to die alone
I don't want to die alone
Way before my time
Is it any wonder
All this empty air
I'm drowning in the laughter
Way before my time has come"
2012,Suddenly,7yXL9VSv7OTTLl3Bv6cA5C,0,,"Suddenly I see
Suddenly it starts
Can two anxious hearts beat as one?
Yesterday I was alone
Today you walk beside me
Something still unclear
Something not yet here has begun.
Suddenly the world
Seems a different place
Somehow full of grace and delight.
How was I to know that so much hope was held inside me?
What has passed is gone
Now we journey on through the night
How was I to know at last that happiness can come so fast?
Trusting me the way you do
I'm so afraid of failing you
Just a child who cannot know that danger follows where I go
There are shadows everywhere
And memories I cannot share
Nevermore alone
Nevermore apart
You have warmed my heart like the sun.
You have brought the gift of life
And love so long denied me.
Suddenly I see
What I could not see
Something suddenly
Has begun."

and I guess the hardest part is
when your heart is broken
and you're lost out in the great wide open
looking for a map
finding your way back
to where you belong

All those years living in a blur
All that time never truly seeing
Things, the way they were

Whiskey has been a thorn in your side
It doesn't forget
The highway that calls for your heart inside

feelin' like a motherless child 
hankered into my soul 
it's bringing me down cant find my smile 
on a face of a motherless child
gonna break down these walls gonna give it my all ya know
yeah yeah yeah yeahhhh

(hang in there with me)
sometimes it takes a different kind of love to raise a child
(so dont give up)
so dont give up
(when pressures come down)
sometimes it takes a different kind of dream to make a smile
(so raise it up) 
so raise it up
(hang in there with me) 
raise it up
sometimes it takes another helping hand to show you the way (oh oh ya)
(so dont give up, when presures come down)
[HOPE] sometimes it seems impossible thats why we pray
so raise it up"
2007,Happy Working Song,7G061Oqw7NXFr1NDTpXoI4,0,,"Come, my little friends
As we all sing a happy little working song
Merry little voices clear and strong
Come and roll your sleeves up so that we can pitch in
Cleaning crud up in the kitchen
As we sing along
Trill a cheery tune in the tub
As we scrub a stubborn mildew stain
Pluck a hairball from the shower drain
To the gay refrain of a happy working song
We'll keep singing without fail
Otherwise we'd spoil it
Hosing down the garbage pail
And scrubbing up the toilet, ooh
How we all enjoy letting loose
With a little la-da-da-dum-dum
While we're emptying the vacuum up
It's such fun to hum a happy working song
Ooh, a happy working song
Oh, how strange a place to be
'Till Edward comes for me, my heart is sighing
Still, as long as I am here
I guess a new experience could be worth trying
Hey, keep trying
You can do a lot when you got
Such a happy working tune to hum
While you're sponging up the soapy scum
We adore each filthy chore that we determine
So friends, even though you're vermin
We're a happy working song
Singing as we fetch the detergent box
For the smelly shirts and the stinky socks
Sing along, if you cannot sing then hum along
As we're finishing our happy working song
Ah, wasn't this fun?"

And all the world is calm
The music playing on for only two
So close together
And when I'm with you
So close to feeling alive
A life goes by
Romantic dreams must die
So I bid my goodbye
And never knew
So close, was waiting
Waiting here with you
And now, forever, I know
All that I wanted
To hold you so close
So close to reaching
That famous happy end
Almost believing
This one's not pretend
And now you're beside me
And look how far we've come
So far we are, so close
Oh how could I face the faceless days
If I should lose you now
We're so close to reaching
That famous happy end
Almost believing
This one's not pretend
Let's go on dreaming
For we know we are
So close, so close
And still so far"

You are on his mind?
Send you yellow flowers when the sky is gray?
Hey
He'll find a new way to show you
A little bit everyday
That's how you know
That's how you know he is your love
You got to show her you need her
Don't treat her like a mind reader
Each day do something to lead her
To believe you love her
Everybody wants to live happily ever after
Everybody wants to know their true love is true
How do you know he loves you?
How do you know he's yours?
Well, does he take you out dancing
Just so he can hold you close?
Dedicate a song with words
Meant just for you?
Ooh
He'll find his own way to tell you
With the little things he'll do
That's how you know
That's how you know he's your love
He's your love

Just so he can match your eyes

I've been so still
Afraid of crumbling
Have I been careless?

Take me where I am supposed to be
To comprehend the things that I can't see
'Cause I need to move
I need to wake up
I need to change
I need to shake up
I need to speak out
Something's got to break up
I've been asleep
And I need to wake up
Now
And as a child
I danced like it was 1999
My dreams were wild
The promise of this new world
Would be mine
Now I am throwing off the carelessness of youth
To listen to an inconvenient truth
That I need to move
I need to wake up
I need to change
I need to shake up
I need to speak out
Something's got to break up
I've been asleep
And I need to wake up

I am not an island
I am not alone
I am my intentions
Trapped here in this flesh and bone
And I need to move
I need to wake up

I need to shake up
I need to speak out
Something's got to break up
I've been asleep
And I need to wake up

2006,Our Town,72V7HVj71eNXogp7y4gfVw,0,,"Long ago, but not so very long ago
The world was different, oh yes, it was
You settled down and you built a town and made it live
And you watched it grow, it was your town
Time goes by, time brings changes, you changed too
Nothing comes that you can't handle, so on you go
You never see it coming when the world caves in on you
On your town, nothing you can do
Main street isn't main street anymore
Lights don't shine as brightly as they shone before
To tell the truth, lights don't shine at all
In our town
Sun comes up each morning, just like it's always done
Get up, go to work, start the day
You open up for business that's never gonna come
As the world rolls by a million miles away
Main street isn't main street anymore
No one seems to need us like they did before
It's hard to find a reason left to stay
But it's our town, love it anyway
Come what may, it's our town"

Done seen people live in poverty with no meals

Life keeps tumbling your heart in circles
Till you... Let go.
Till you shed your pride, and you climb to heaven,
And you throw yourself off.

But I know I must keep travelin' till my road comes to an end 
I'm out here on my journey, trying to make the most of it 
I'm a puzzle, I must figure out where all my pieces fit 
Like a poor wayfaring stranger that they speak about in song 
I'm just a weary pilgrim trying to find what feels like home 
Where that is no one can tell me, am I doomed to ever roam 
I'm just travelin', travelin', travelin', I'm just travelin' on 
Questions I have many, answers but a few 
But we're here to learn, the spirit burns, to know the greater truth 
We've all been crucified and they nailed Jesus to the tree 
And when I'm born again, you're gonna see a change in me 
God made me for a reason and nothing is in vain 
Redemption comes in many shapes with many kinds of pain 
Oh sweet Jesus if you're listening, keep me ever close to you 
As I'm stumblin', tumblin', wonderin', as I'm travelin' thru 
I'm just travelin', travelin', travelin', I'm just travelin' thru 
I'm just travelin', travelin', travelin', I'm just travelin' thru 
Oh sometimes the road is rugged, and it's hard to travel on 
But holdin' to each other, we don't have to walk alone 
When everything is broken, we can mend it if we try 
We can make a world of difference, if we want to we can fly 
Goodbye little children, goodnight you handsome men 
Farewell to all you ladies and to all who knew me when 
And I hope I'll see you down the road, you meant more than I knew 
As I was travelin', travelin', travelin', travelin', travelin' thru 
I'm just travelin', travelin', travelin', I'm just travelin' 
Drifting like a floating boat and roaming like the wind 
Oh give me some direction lord, let me lean on you 
As I'm travelin', travelin', travelin', thru 
I'm just travelin', travelin', travelin', I'm just travelin' thru 
I'm just travelin', travelin', travelin', I'm just travelin' thru

I'm just a weary pilgrim trying to find my own way home

Soon you will see
All of your fears will pass away
Safe in my arms
You're only sleeping
What can you see
On the horizon?
Why do the white gulls call?

A pale moon rises
The ships have come to carry you home
And all will turn
To silver glass
A light on the water
All Souls pass
Hope fades
Into the world of night
Through shadows falling
Out of memory and time
Don't say
We have come now to the end

And you'll be here in my arms

Must I accept his fate

A little bird did sing
Man has no choice
When he wants every thing
We´ll rise above the scarlet tide
That trickles down through the mountain
And separates the widow from the bride
Man goes beyond his own decision
Gets caught in a mechanism
And swindlers who works like kings
And broke those who break everything
The dark of night was swiftly fading
Close to the dawn of day
Why would I want him just to lose him again
We´ll rise above the scarlet tide
That trickles down through the mountain
And separates the widow from the bride"

The cannon balls fly 'round my head
The infirmary man may count me dead

2002,Lose Yourself,77Ft1RJngppZlq59B6uP0z,1,,"Look
If you had
One shot
Or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
In one moment
Would you capture it
Or just let it slip?
Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgettin'
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now
The clocks run out, times up, over, blaow!
Snap back to reality, oh there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No
He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke
He's so stagnant, he knows, when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when its
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime 
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime 
You better
His soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is borin', but super stardom's close to post mortar
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
He blows, it's all over, these hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the Globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmo who flows, he nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on
Da-da-dum, da-dum, da-da
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime 
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime 
You better
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playin' in the beginnin', the mood all changed
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine to
Five and I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family 'cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And its no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer
This is my life and these times are so hard
And it's getting even harder tryna feed and water my seed, plus
Teeter-totter, caught up between bein' a father and a prima-donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much
For me to wanna stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go, I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go, is my shot
Feet, fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime 
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime 
You better
You can do anything you set your mind to, man"

Although all hope seems gone
I just move on
When I can't find a single star
To hang my wish upon
I just move on
I mooooove on
I run so fast
A shot gun blast
Can't hurt me not one bit
I'm on my toes
'cause heaven knows
A moving target's hard to hit
So as we play
In life's ballet
We're not the dying swan
We just move on
We mooooove on
Just when it seems
We're out of dreams
And things have got us down
[VELMA]
We don't despair
We don't go there
We hang our bonnets out of town
So there's no doubt
We're well cut out
To run life's marathon
We just move on
We just move on
So fleet of foot
We can'ts stay put
We just move on
Yes we move on!"

2002,The Hands That Built America,7dVXb3ILrvzeScPRXmASXW,0,,"Oh my love
It's a long way we've come
From the freckled hills
To the steel and glass canyons
From the stony fields
To hanging steel from skies
From digging in our pockets
For a reason not to say goodbye
These are the hands that built America
Ah, ah, ah, America
Last saw your face
In a water colored sky
As sea birds argue a long goodbye
I took your kiss
On the spray of a new lined star
You gotta live in your dreams
Don't make them so hard
And these are the hands that built America
Ah, ah, ah, America
Of all of the promises
Is this one we can keep
Of all of the dreams
Is this one still out of reach?
It's early fall
There's a cloud in the New York skyline
Innocence dragged across a yellow line
These are the hands that built America
These are the hands that built America
Ah, ah, ah, America
Ah, ah, ah, America"

In the mirror of a bad dream
And for a fraction of a second,
You can't remember where you are
Just open your window
And follow your memories
Upstream
To the meadow in the mountain
Where we counted every falling star
I believe the light that shines on you
Will shine on you forever
(Forever)
And though I can't guarantee there's nothing scary
Hidin' under your bed
I'm gonna
Stand guard
Like the postcard
Of the golden retriever
And never leave
'Til I leave you
With a sweet dream in your head
I'm gonna watch you shine
Gonna watch you grow
Gonna paint a sign
So you always know
As long as one and one is two
Ooh ooh
There could never be a father
Love his daughter more than I love you
Trust your intuition
It's just like going fishin'
You cast your line and
Hope you get a bite
But you don't need to waste your time
Worryin' about the marketplace
Trying to help the human race
Struggling to survive
It's as harsh as night
I'm gonna watch you shine
Gonna watch you grow
Gonna paint a sign
So you always know
As long as one and one is two

There could never be a father
Love his daughter more than I love you

That's how it always should be
One without the other
Don't mean nothing to me
Nothing to me

I'm just a punky little eyeball
With an ugly little optic nerve
Hey, I never told you this but
You know sometimes I get a little blue
But I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have you
Dance with me
I wouldn't be nothing

Where the world is impossibly still
With a million dreams to fulfill
And a matter of moments until the dancing ends

Saddled up the moon so we could ride
Until the stars grew dim, Until?
One day you'll meet a stranger 
And all the noise is silenced in the room
you'll feel that you´re close to some mystery
In the moonlight when everything shatters
You´ll feel as if you've known her all your life
The world?s oldest lesson in history
Here in your arms

With a million dreams to fulfill
And a matter of moments until the dancing ends
Here in your arms

Got white skin, got assassin's eyes
I'm looking up into the sapphire tinted skies
I'm well dressed, waiting on the last train
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose
Any minute now I'm expecting all hell to break loose
People are crazy and times are strange
I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range
I used to care, but things have changed
This place ain't doing me any good
I'm in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood
Just for a second there I thought I saw something move
Gonna take dancing lessons do the jitterbug rag
Ain't no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag
Only a fool in here would think he's got anything to prove
Lotta water under the bridge, lotta other stuff too
Don't get up gentlemen, I'm only passing through
People are crazy and times are strange
I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range

If the bible is right, the world will explode
I've been trying to get as far away from myself as I can
Some things are too hot to touch
The human mind can only stand so much
You can't win with a losing hand
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet
Putting her in a wheel barrow and wheeling her down the street
People are crazy and times are strange
I'm locked in tight, I'm out of range
I used to care, but things have changed
I hurt easy, I just don't show it
You can hurt someone and not even know it
The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity
Gonna get lowdown, gonna fly high
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie
I'm love with a woman who don't even appeal to me
Mr. Jinx and Miss Lucy, they jumped in the lake
I'm not that eager to make a mistake

If the seas run dry, turned to dust

By the light I see in your eyes.
The world I know fades away
But you stay.
As the earth reclaims its due,
And the cycle starts anew,
We'll stay, always
In the love that we have
Shared before time.
If the years take away
Every memory that I have
I would still know the way
That would lead me back to your side.
The North star may die
But the light that I see in your eyes
Will burn there always
By the love we have
Shared before time.
When the forest turns to jade,
And the stories that we've made
Dissolve away
One shining light will still remain.
When we shed our earthly skin,
When our real life begins,
There'll be no shame
Just the love that we have made before time."

That the world is not my playground
There are other things that matter
And when a simple needs protecting (*see below)

The only world I know was upside down
And now the world and me, I know you carry me

Would those lucky guys turn out to be
But that unusual blend of my funny friend and me
I'm not as clever as I thought I was
I'm not the boy I used to be because
You showed me something different, you showed me something pure
I always seemed so certain but I was really never sure
But you stayed and you called my name
When others would have walked out on a lousy game
And you could've made it through
But your funny friend and me
You see the patterns in the big sky
Those constellations look like you and I
That tiny planet in a bigger guy
I don't know whether I should laugh or cry
Just like the patterns in the big sky

Don't know the answer or the reason why

And flappin' heads so full of liesBlame Canada, blame Canada
We need to form a full assault
It's Canada's fault Don't blame me for my son Stan
He saw the darn cartoon
And now he's off to join the KlanAnd my boy Eric once
Had my picture on his shelf
But now when I see him he tells me to fuck myselfWell, blame Canada, blame Canada
It seems that everything's gone wrong
Since Canada came alongBlame Canada, blame Canada
There not even a real country anywayMy son could've been a doctor or a lawyer rich and true
Instead he burned up like a piggy on a barbecueShould we blame the matches?
Should we blame the fire?
Or the doctors who allowed him to expire?
Heck no
Blame Canada, blame Canada
With all their hockey hullabaloo
And that bitch Anne Murray too
Blame Canada, shame on CanadaThe smut we must stop, the trash we must smash
Laughter and fun must all be undone
We must blame them and cause a fuss
Before someone thinks of blaming us"

Everything was beautiful

Lives within my heart
And when she was sad
I was there to dry her tears
And when was happy so was I
When she loved me
Through the summer and the fall
We had each other, that was all
Just she and I together
Like it was meant to be
And when she was lonely
I was there to comfort her
And I knew that she loved me
So the years went by
I stayed the same
But she began to drift away
I was left alone
Still I waited for the day
When she'd say, ""I will always love you""
Lonely and forgotten
Never thought she'd look my way
And she smiled at me and held me
Just like she used to do
Like she loved me
When she loved me
When somebody loved me
Everything was beautiful
Every hour spent together
Lives within my heart
When she loved me"

We were moving mountains
Long before we knew we could, whoa, yes
There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail
Its hard to kill
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve
When you believe somehow you will
You will when you believe
Mmmyeah
In this time of fear
When prayer so often proves in vain
Hope seems like the summer bird
Too swiftly flown away
Yet now I'm standing here
My hearts so full, I can't explain
Seeking faith and speakin' words
I never thought I'd say
There can be miracles

Says hope is very near, oh (Oh)

And you're tired and cold and wet
And you're looking for a place that's cozy and warm
You'll make it, if you can never forget
Kind and steady heart, can conquer doubt and fear

Gets you a little bit farther down the road each day

Looking for a soft place
Nothing more than a small taste
Of a love that ended long ago
Looking for a place to hide
A warm bed on a cold night
I didn't mean to hurt you
No, no, no
Looking out your window at the dawn

I know someone's waiting
Years of dreams just can't be wrong!
Arms will open wide.
I'll be safe and wanted
Fin'lly home where I belong.

On this journey to the past Home, Love, Family.
There was once a time
I must have had them, too.
Home, Love, Family, 
I will never be complete 
Until I find you...
One step at a time,
One hope, then another,
Who knows where this road may go 
Back to who I was,
On to find my future.
Things my heart still needs to know.
Yes, let this be a sign!
Let this road be mine!
Let it lead me to my past
And bring me home...
At last!"

To put bad thoughts in my head
Two tickets torn in half
And a lot of nothing to do
Do you miss me, miss misery

A man in the park
Read the lines in my hand
Told me I'm strong
Hardly ever wrong I said, ""man, you're mean""
You had plans for both of us
That involved a trip out of town
To a place I've seen in a magazine
That you left lying around
I don't have you with me but
I keep a good attitude
Do you miss me, miss misery
Like you say you do? 
I know you'd rather see me gone
Than to see me the way that I am
But I am in the life anyway
Next door the tv's flashing
Blue frames on the wall
It's a comedy of errors, you see
It's about taking a fall
To vanish into oblivion
Is easy to do
And I try to be but you know me
I come back when you want me to
Do you miss me miss misery

Where the crowds would cheer, when they see my face

I'll be there someday, I can go the distance
I will find my way if I can be strong
I know every mile would be worth my while
When I go the distance, I'll be right where I belong
Down an unknown road to embrace my fate
Though that road may wander, it will lead me to you
And a thousand years would be worth the wait
It might take a lifetime but somehow I'll see it through
And I won't look back, I can go the distance
And I'll stay on track, no I won't accept defeat
It's an uphill slope
But I won't loose hope, 'till I go the distance
And my journey is complete, oh yeah
But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part
For a hero's strength is measured by his heart, oh
Like a shooting star, I will go the distance
I will search the world, I will face its harms
I don't care how far, I can go the distance

I will search the world, I will face its harms

Can you paint with all the colors of the wind

Come taste the sun sweet berries of the Earth
Come roll in all the riches all around you

All the words you say
Make it relatively easy
To be swept away
In the half light
Can we trust the way we feel
Can we be sure that anything is real?

Stars keep secrets as they wander indiscretely
While the echoes of a song go drifting by
We must be careful not to lose our way completely
Or the magic that we seek here
We can't be sure will be here

In the morning
With the moon away
And if in each other's arms
Is where we're meant to stay

In the love light
When our eyes have grown accustomed to the daylight
We'll see what waits for us to share
For all the things we've dreamed of in the moonlight
Will be there "

There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you

'Cause you've got a friend in me

Some other folks might be
A little bit smarter than I am
Bigger and stronger too, maybe
But none of them will ever love you
The way I do, it's me and you, boy

Our friendship will never die
You're gonna see it's our destiny

1994,Can You Feel the Love Tonight,0EANX0OVKSCcmarY50Xa4p,1,,"There's a calm surrender
To the rush of day
When the heat of a rolling wave
Can be turned away
An enchanted moment
And it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior
Just to be with you
And can you feel the love tonight?
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we've got this far
And can you feel the love tonight? (Tonight)
How it's laid to rest?
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best
There's a time for everyone
If they only learn
That the twisting kaleidoscope
Moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason
To the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager
Beats in time with yours
And can you feel the love tonight? (Tonight)
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we've got this far
And can you feel the love tonight? (Tonight)

Everything is changing, now we'll never be the same

Will we ever learn to trust
We're running out of time, there's so little time
Baby look what love has done to me
Oh, yeah
Now it's late at night, i'm here without you
I'm trying to make my way to where you are
Can't you see, i'll still be here waiting
Can't you see, our two hearts were always meant to be as one
Look at what love has done to us
When will we ever learn to trust
We're running out of time, there's so little time, baby
Will you look what love has done to me
I'm calling out your name, baby

And blinking, step into the sun

Some say live and let live

And some of us soar to the stars
And some of us sail through our troubles
And some have to live with the scars

More to find than can ever be found

Keeps great and small on the endless round

On the Streets of Philadelphia

I heard the voices of friends vanished and gone
At night I could hear the blood in my veins
It was just as black and whispering as the rain
On the Streets of Philadelphia

Ain't no angel gonna greet me
It's just you and I, my friend
My clothes don't fit me no more
I walked a thousand miles
Just to slip this skin

The night has fallen, I'm lyin' awake
I can feel myself fading away

Roll over Beethoven
Won't you play with me
And I'll never promise to be true to anyone
Unless it's you
Unless it's you

Place I call home
Don't turn your back on me
I don't want to be alone
Love lasts forever.

Someone is talking to me,
Calling my name
Tell me I'm not to blame
I won't be ashamed of love.

Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again
A wounded heart you gave
My soul you took away
Good intentions you had many
I know you did
I come from a place that hurts
And God knows how I've cried
And I never want to return
never fall again
Making love to you
Oh it felt so good and
Oh so right
How can I be strong I've asked myself
Time and time I've said
That I'll never fall in love with you again
So here we are alone again'
Didn't think it'd come to this
And to know it all began
With just a little kiss
I've come too close to happiness
To have it swept away
Don't think I can take the pain
No never fall again
Kinda late in the game and my heart is in
Your hands
Don't you stand there and then
Tell me you love
Me then leave again
Cause I'm falling in love with
You again
Hold me
Hold me
Don't ever let me go
Say it just one time
Say you love me
God knows I do
Love you
Again"

Of hanging around in sleepy towns, forever
Back roads empty for miles
Well you can't have a dream and cut it to fit
But when I saw you I knew, we'd go together
Like a wink and a smile
Leave your old jalopy
Buy the railroad track
We'll get a hip, double dip, tip toppy
Two seat Pontiac
So you can rev her up, don't go slow
It's only green lights and alright
Let's go together with a wink and a smile
Give me a wink and a smile
We go together like a wink and a smile
Now my heart is music, such a simple song
Sing it again the notes never end
This is where I belong
Just the sound of your voice
The light in your eyes
We're so far away from yesterday
Together, with a wink and a smile
We go together like a wink and a smile"

A new fantastic point of view

Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky

I'll chase them anywhere

In the magic of love

Lovers dreaming in the night
Reaching for paradise
But as the dark shadows fade
Love slips away
On an empty stretch of beach
In the pattern of the waves
Drawing pictures with my hand
In the sand, I see your face
Skipping pebbles on the sea
Wishing for paradise
Sand castles crumble below
The restless tides ebb and flow
Listening to a shell
Hoping for your voice
Beautiful Maria of my soul
Though we'll always be apart
Locked forever in a dream
If I ever love again
Even then, nothing will change
And the taste of you remains
Clinging to paradise
But as the distance from you grows
All that my heart ever knows
Hunger for your kiss
Longing for your touch
Beautiful Maria of my soul
Filling all my nights
Haunting all my days"

Tie your napkin 'round your neck, cherie

Why, we only live to serve
Try the grey stuff, it's delicious
Don't believe me, ask the dishes

And a dinner here is never second best

Sake's alive, well I'll be blessed!
Wine's been poured and thank the Lord
I've had the napkins freshly pressed
With dessert, she'll want tea
And my dear that's fine with me
While the cups do their soft-shoein'
I'll be bubbling, I'll be brewing
I'll get warm, piping hot
Heaven's sakes! Is that a spot?
Clean it up, we want the company impressed
We've got a lot to do!
Is it one lump or two?
For you, our guest (she's our guest)

Our command is your request
It's been years since we've had anybody here
And we're obsessed
With your meal, with your ease

While the candlelight's still glowing
Let us help you, we'll keep going
Course by course, one by one

It's a quiet village
Every day
Like the one before
Little town
Full of little people
Waking up to say
Bonjour bonjour
Bonjour bonjour bonjour
There goes the baker with his tray, like always
The same old bread and rolls to sell
Every morning just the same
Since the morning that we came
To this poor provincial town
Good morning, Belle
Good morning, monsieur Jean
Have you lost something again?
Well, I believe I have
Problem is, I've, I can't remember what
Oh well, I'm sure it'll come to me
Where you off to?
To return this book to Pere Robert, it's about to lovers in fair Verona
Sound boring
Look there she goes, that girl is strange, no question
Dazed and distracted, can't you tell?
Never part of any crowd
'Cause her head's up on some cloud
No denying she's a funny girl that Belle
Bonjour, good day
How is your family?
Bonjour, good day
How is your wife?
I need six eggs
That's too expensive!
There must be more than this provincial life!
Ah, If it isn't the only bookworm in town!
So, where did you run off to this week?
Two cities in Northern Italy
I didn't want to come back
Have you got any new places to go?
I'm afraid not
But you may re-read any of the old ones that you'd like
Your library makes our small corner of the world feel big
Bon voyage
Look there she goes, that girl is so peculiar
I wonder if she's feeling well
With a dreamy, far-off look
And her nose stuck in a book
What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle
Oh, isn't this amazing?
It's my favorite part because you'll see
Here's where she meets Prince Charming
But she won't discover that it's him 'til chapter three!
Now it's no wonder that her name means Beauty
Her looks have got no parallel
But behind that fair facade
I'm afraid she's rather odd
Very different from the rest of us
She's nothing like the rest of us
Yes, different from the rest of us is Belle!
Look at her, LeFou
My future wife
Belle is the most beautiful girl in the village
That's makes her the best
But she's so well-read
And you're so athletically-inclined
Yes, ever since the war, I felt like I've been missing something
She's the only girl that ever given me that sense of
Mmm je ne sais quoi?
I don't know what that means
Right from the moment when I met her, saw her
I said she's gorgeous and I fell
Here in town there's only she
Who is beautiful as me
So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle
Look there he goes
Isn't he dreamy?
Monsieur Gaston
Oh, he's so cute!
Be still my heart
I'm hardly breathing
He's such a tall, dark, strong and handsome brute!
Bonjour, pardon
Good day, mais oui!
You call this bacon, what lovely flowers
Some cheese, ten yards, one pound, excuse me I'll get the knife
Please let me through!
This bread, those fish, it's stale, they smell!
Madame's mistaken Well, maybe so
There must be more than this provincial life!
Just watch, I'm going to make Belle my wife!
Look there she goes the girl is strange, but special
A most peculiar mademoiselle!
It's a pity and a sin
She doesn't quite fit in
'Cause she really is a funny girl
A beauty but a funny girl
She really is a funny girl

Which of them belongs to me
Which one I wonder?
And any star I choose
Watches over me
So I know I'm not alone
When I'm here on my own
Isn't that a wonder?
When you're alone
You're not alone
Not really alone
The stars are all my friends
Till the night time ends
So I know I'm not alone
When I'm here on my own
Isn't that a wonder?
When you're alone
You're not alone
Not really alone"
1991,(Everything I Do) I Do It for You,5HQ6AUDMbMuwktvcNPuV1y,0,,"Look into my eyes
You will see
What you mean to me
Search your heart
Search your soul
And when you find me there
You'll search no more
Don't tell me it's not worth tryin' for
You can't tell me it's not worth dyin' for
You know it's true
Everything I do
I do it for you
Look into your heart
You will find
There's nothin' there to hide
Take me as I am
Take my life
I would give it all
I would sacrifice
Don't tell me it's not worth fightin' for
I can't help it, there's nothin' I want more
You know it's true
Everything I do
I do it for you
There's no love
Like your love
And no other
Could give more love
There's nowhere
Unless you're there
All the time
All the way, yeah
Look into your heart, baby
Oh you can't tell me it's not worth tryin' for
I can't help it, there's nothin' I want more
Yeah, I would fight for you
I lie for you
Walk the wire for you
Yeah, I'd die for you
You know it's true
Everything I do
Oh

Everything I do, darling
And we'll see it through
Oh we'll see it through
Oh yeah

Look into your heart
Look at your soul
You can't tell me it ain't worth dying for
Oh yeah
I'll be there, yeah
I'll walk the wire for you
I will die for you
Oh yeah
I would die for you
I'm going all the way, all they way, yeah"
1990,Sooner or Later,0QLuoNpyzXMcCLfVtFScE2,1,,"Sooner or later you're gonna be mine
Sooner or later you're gonna be fine
Baby, it's time that you face it
I always get my man
Sooner or later you're gonna decide
Sooner or later there's nowhere to hide
Baby, it's time, so why waste it in chatter?
Let's settle the matter
Baby, you're mine on a platter
I always get my man
But if you insist, babe, the challenge delights me
The more you resist, babe, the more it excites me
And no one I've kissed, babe, ever fights me again
If you're on my list, it's just a question of when
When I get a yen, then baby, Amen
I'm counting to ten, and then
I'm gonna love you like nothing you've known
I'm gonna love you, and you all alone
Sooner is better than later but lover
I'll hover, I'll plan
This time I'm not only getting
I'm holding my man"
1990,Promise Me You'll Remember,7nshPgYDCnvhc8li1t2pYq,0,Not sure if it's the original,"Promise me you'll remember 
This love together today 
We may not have tomorrow 
It's not for us to say 
Fate isn't kind to lovers 
It breaks the hardest hearts
Promise you'll remember 
How good we are 
Why do I find the sadness 
Under your sweetest kiss 
Destiny seems to whisper 
It won't stay like this 
Whenever we're together 
I feel time standing still 
I only know I love you 
And I always will 
If we should lose each other 
Somewhere inside the dark 
Promise me you'll remember 
How good we are 
Whenever we're together 
I feel time standing still 
I only know I love you 
And I always will 
If we should lose each other 
Somewhere inside the dark 
Promise me you'll remember 
How good we are
Time isn't kind to lovers 
It breaks the hardest hearts
Promise me you'll remember
How good we are"
1990,Somewhere in My Memory,1WA5av9UlqPNOKcaUdWbGM,0,,"Candles in the window
Shadows painting the ceiling
Gazing at the fire glow
Feeling that gingerbread feeling
Precious moments, special people
Happy faces, I can see
Somewhere in my memory
Christmas joys all around me
Living in my memory
All of the music, all of the magic
All of the family, home here with me"
1990,I'm Checkin' Out,,0,Not on Spotify,"Pull back them dark and dusty drapes
And let in some light
Tell the bell-boy come and get my trunk
'Cause I'm leavin' here tonight
I packed my bags and paid my bill
And I'm turnin' in my key
And if those sad souls down in the lobby ask for me
Just tell'em
I'm checkin' out of this heartbreak hotel
I ain't gonna live on lonely street no more (no more)
I've found a new love and a new place to dwell
Where teardrops ain't soakin' the floor
So, take down my suitcase and hand me my hat
I'm goin' from sleazy to swell.
Give that desk-clerk a dime
And you can just tell him that I'm
Checkin' out of the heartbreak hotel

Well, you can give that sad bellboy
My old blues guitar
'Cause I'm only gonna sing them sweet songs
From now on, yeah
And you can tell that old bartender
He might as well close down the bar
Cause Chug-a-Luggin' Sally's packed an' gone
Through that gray windowpane
It always looked like rain
But there's sunshine outside I can tell
So open up that door, I'me leavin'
An' I won't be back no more
I'm checkin' out of this heartbreak hotel
Checkin' out of this heartbreak hotel"
1990,Blaze of Glory,0XwjdpwvEwukcg3XU4Ibzt,0,,"I wake up in the morning
And I raise my weary head
I've got an old coat for a pillow
And the earth was last night's bed
I don't know where I'm going
Only God knows where I've been
I'm a devil on the run
A six gun lover
A candle in the wind
When you're brought into this world
They say you're born in sin
Well at least they gave me something
I didn't have to steal or have to win
Well they tell me that I'm wanted
Yeah, I'm a wanted man
I'm a colt in your stable
I'm what Cain was to Abel
Mister catch me if you can
I'm going out in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
I'm going out in a blaze of glory
Lord I never drew first
But I drew first blood
I'm no one's son
Call me young gun
You ask about my conscience
And I offer you my soul
You ask if I'll grow to be a wise man
Well I ask if I'll grow old
You ask me if I've known love
And what it's like to sing songs in the rain
Well, I've seen love come
And I've seen it shot down
I've seen it die in vain
Shot down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
'Cause I'm going down in a blaze of glory
Lord I never drew first
But I drew first blood
I'm the devil's son
Call me young gun
Each night I go to bed
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
No I ain't looking for forgiveness
But before I'm six foot deep
Lord, I got to ask a favor
And hope you'll understand
'Cause I've lived life to the fullest
Let this boy die like a man
Staring down a bullet
Let me make my final stand
Shot down in a blaze of glory
Take me now but know the truth
I'm going out in a blaze of glory
Lord I never drew first
But I drew first blood
And I'm no one's son
Call me young gun
I'm a young gun
Young gun, yeah yeah yeah
Young gun"
1989,Under the Sea,6oYkwjI1TKP9D0Y9II1GT7,1,,"The seaweed is always greener
In somebody else's lake
You dream about going up there
But that is a big mistake
Just look at the world around you
Right here on the ocean floor
Such wonderful things surround you
What more is you lookin' for?
Under the sea
Under the sea
Darling it's better
Down where it's wetter
Take it from me
Up on the shore they work all day
Out in the sun they slave away
While we devotin'
Full time to floatin'
Under the sea
Down here all the fish is happy
As off through the waves they roll
The fish on the land ain't happy
They sad 'cause they in their bowl
But fish in the bowl is lucky
They in for a worser fate
One day when the boss get hungry
Guess who's gon' be on the plate?
Under the sea
Under the sea
Nobody beat us
Fry us and eat us
In fricassee
We what the land folks loves to cook
Under the sea we off the hook
We got no troubles
Life is the bubbles
Under the sea (Under the sea)
Under the sea (Under the sea)
Since life is sweet here
We got the beat here
Naturally (Naturally)
Even the sturgeon an' the ray
They get the urge 'n' start to play
We got the spirit
You got to hear it
Under the sea
The newt play the flute
The carp play the harp
The plaice play the bass
And they soundin' sharp
The bass play the brass
The chub play the tub
The fluke is the duke of soul
(Yeah)
The ray he can play
The lings on the strings
The trout rockin' out
The blackfish she sings
The smelt and the sprat
They know where it's at
An' oh that blowfish blow
Yeah, under the sea (Under the sea)
Under the sea (Under the sea)
When the sardine
Begin the beguine
It's music to me (It's music to me)
What do they got? A lot of sand
We got a hot crustacean band
Each little clam here
Know how to jam here
Under the sea
Each little slug here
Cuttin' a rug here
Under the sea
Each little snail here
Know how to wail here
That's why it's hotter
Under the water
Ya we in luck here
Down in the muck here
Under the sea"
1988,Let the River Run,0ubzTDRfqwMcmbbpK15sQX,1,,"We're coming to the edge
Running on the water
Coming through the fog
Your sons and daughters
Let the river run
Let all the dreamers
Wake the nation
Come, the New Jerusalem
Silver cities rise
The morning lights
The streets that meet them
And sirens call them on
With a song
It's asking for the taking
Trembling, shaking
Oh, my heart is aching
We're coming to the edge
Running on the water
Coming through the fog
Your sons and daughters
We the great and small
Stand on a star
And blaze a trail of desire
Through the dark'ning dawn
It's asking for the taking
Come run with me now
The sky is the color of blue
You've never even seen
In the eyes of your lover
Oh, my heart is aching
We're coming to the edge
Running on the water
Coming through the fog
Your sons and daughters
It's asking for the taking
Trembling, shaking
Oh, my heart is aching
We're coming to the edge
Running on the water
Coming through the fog
Your sons and daughters
Let the river run (let the river run)
Let all the dreamers (let all the dreamers)
Wake the nation (wake the nation)
Come, the New Jerusalem"
